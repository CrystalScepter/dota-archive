# DotA Archive

This repository contains most DotA Classic and DotA Allstars maps released for Warcraft 3, for preservation purposes.

Most of these maps can be played with a v1.27b ROC/TFT, but some of them require an older patch, such as v1.21b or v1.04.

# Missing Maps

A table with all versions that have existed can be found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSFpQlcKqDru8_Wn6asztP9k4SnAQcFEnneKEvcjdooYYNo1LJmhx8JurN-0zup2g/pubhtml).

If you have a map that is currently missing in the archive, please send it through an issue file.
